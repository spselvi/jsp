jsp:
  JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology.  it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc.
  A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags. The JSP pages are easier to maintain than Servlet because we can separate designing and development.some additional features such as expression, custom tags  etc.
Advantages of JSP over Servlet:
    Extension to Servlet:
        JSP technology is the extension to Servlet technology.we can use implicit objects, predefined tags, expression language and Custom tags in JSP, that makes JSP development      easy.
     Easy to maintain:
        we can easily separate our business logic with presentation logic. In Servlet technology, we mix our business logic with the presentation logic.
    Fast Development: No need to recompile and redeploy:
        If JSP page is modified, we don't need to recompile and redeploy the project.
